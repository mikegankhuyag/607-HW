For my API I searched for all articles containing 'Obama' on 01/01/2012. Facet count will be returned for 'day_of_week' and will be reflective of all documents (i.e., the date range filter and filter query do not affect facet counts) and used the suggested URL example.

```{r}
Url <- 'http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?fq=obama&facet_field=day_of_week&begin_date=20120101&end_date=20120101&api-key=5a5379a7e4fa4b37964e7a36920eccdb'
Url
```

Since it is JSON document, I used the FromJSON function to read the information.

```{r}
Obama <- fromJSON(Url)
Obama
```
```{r}
Response <- data.frame(Obama$response)
Response
```
